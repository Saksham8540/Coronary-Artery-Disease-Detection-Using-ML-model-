# Diagnosing-Coronary-Artery-Disease-using-Machine-learning-
This project aims to diagnose Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using machine learning techniques applied to medical imaging data. Leveraging an image dataset sourced from Kaggle, multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to classify chest X-ray images for early detection of CAD, aiding in non-invasive diagnosis.
